# Running the project

Node version 18.17 or later is required to run the project
Can be downloaded from [Node](https://nodejs.org/en)

The easiest way of running the project is typing the following command in a terminal:

npm run dev

That will start a development server and the project in development mode

Alternatively you can create a production build by running the following command in a terminal:

npm run build 

And then run the command for starting the server by typing:

npm run start
